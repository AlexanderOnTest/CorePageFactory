# CorePageFactory
As discussed in my blog at https://alexanderontesting.com/2018/05/21/c-and-the-disappearing-pagefactory-my-next-steps-in-selenium-testing/; the previous incarnation of the dotnet PageFactory was obsoleted due to its incompatibility with .Net Core.

This is my attempt at building a new Selenium WebDriver Page Factory for .Net Core.
